🚀 Enhanced SpotFake: Cross-Modal Attention + Contrastive Learning\n\n**Goal**: Improve fake news detection accuracy by integrating:\n- ✅ **Cross-Modal Attention**: Text ↔ Image interaction\n- ✅ **Contrastive Learning**: Align genuine text-image pairs\n- ✅ **Grad-CAM Compatible**: No pooling='avg', proper gradient flow\n\n**Development Approach**: Incremental phases\n- **Phase 1**: Base architecture with Grad-CAM support ← START HERE\n- **Phase 2**: Add cross-modal attention\n- **Phase 3**: Add contrastive learning\n- **Phase 4**: Full training and evaluation\n\n**Target**: 83-85%
