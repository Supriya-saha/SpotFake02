# Google Colab TPU Requirements
# Optimized for Google Colab environment with TPU support
# Many packages are pre-installed in Colab, only specify what needs updating/adding

# Core ML Libraries
# Note: TensorFlow is pre-installed in Colab, but specify version for TPU compatibility
tensorflow>=2.15.0
tensorflow-hub>=0.16.0
keras>=3.0.0

# NLP Models
transformers>=4.35.0
tokenizers>=0.15.0

# Data Processing
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
opencv-python>=4.8.0
pillow>=10.0.0

# Visualization
matplotlib>=3.7.0
seaborn>=0.13.0

# Progress bars
tqdm>=4.66.0

# Machine Learning Utils
scikit-learn>=1.3.0

# For better notebook experience
ipywidgets>=8.1.0

# Additional utilities (if needed)
h5py>=3.10.0  # Usually pre-installed
scipy>=1.11.0  # Usually pre-installed

# Installation Instructions:
# =======================
# In Google Colab, run:
# !pip install -r requirements_colab.txt
#
# For TPU setup, also add to your notebook:
# import tensorflow as tf
# resolver = tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver()
# tf.config.experimental_connect_to_cluster(resolver)
# tf.tpu.experimental.initialize_tpu_system(resolver)
# strategy = tf.distribute.TPUStrategy(resolver)
#
# Then wrap model creation with:
# with strategy.scope():
#     model = get_news_model(params_final)
